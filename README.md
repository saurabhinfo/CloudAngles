Please make a native iOS application that finds local Starbucks locations via any Google API.

The app should meet the following requirements:

- Display a list of locally found Starbucks locations.

Additional notes:

- Application must be written entirely in Swift and SwiftUI.

- Application should include fully functioning API request/response logic using native libraries (no 3rd party libraries).

- Application must compile and run correctly in the iPhone Simulator (physical device verification not needed).

- Use any architectural pattern of your choice.

- UI can be a simple table view with address(title) and distance(subtitle).

Bonus:

- Each item in the list should be tappable.

- On tap a Map View should open with a pin drop to show the selected Starbucks location.

- There should be a way to return to the list view from the map view.
